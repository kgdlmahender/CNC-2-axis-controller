# 2-Axis CNC Controller  

## Overview  
This project is a 2-axis CNC controller designed for precision movements and automated cutting tasks. It supports functionalities like:  
- Continuous jogging  
- Distance-based movement  
- G-code execution for path cutting  

The project integrates **VB.NET** for the user interface and **Arduino UNO** for motor control of machines.
